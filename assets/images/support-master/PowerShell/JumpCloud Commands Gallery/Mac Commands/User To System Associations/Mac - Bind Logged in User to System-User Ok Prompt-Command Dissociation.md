#### Description

After importing this command the variables `JCAPIKey=''` and `commandID=''` must populated before the command can be run.

`JCAPIKey=''` should be populated with a JumpCloud API key. This command makes API calls to the JumpCloud admin console. The JumpCloud API key can only be seen by JumpCloud administrators and is not exposed or stored on target systems when this command is run.

![commanID example](https://github.com/TheJumpCloud/support/blob/master/PowerShell/JumpCloud%20Commands%20Gallery/Files/commandID.png?raw=true)

To find the `commandID` value within the JumpCloud admin console select the command to expand the command details. Within the URL of the selected command the commandID will be the 24 character string between 'commands/' and '/details'. The JumpCloud PowerShell command [Get-JCCommand](https://github.com/TheJumpCloud/support/wiki/Get-JCCommand) can also be used to find the commandID which will reveal the commandID in the '_id' field.

This command will query the current logged in user on the system and determine if the logged in user is an active JumpCloud user. If the logged is user is an active JumpCloud user the command will query the system and determine if the user has already been bound to the system. If the user has not been bound to the system the command will prompt the user and inform them that the JumpCloud agent will takeover their local account. If users say **Ok** at the prompt the agent will bind the user to the system with their existing system permissions (admin or standard) and then log the user out and take them to the login window to ensure account takeover occurs. If the prompt times out after 120 seconds, the command will return an exitCode of 1 and return this information to log section of the command result.

If the command exits with an exitCode of 0 the target system will be removed from the JumpCloud command using the `commandID=''` variable.


#### *Import This Command*

To import this command into your JumpCloud tenant run the below command using the [JumpCloud PowerShell Module](https://github.com/TheJumpCloud/support/wiki/Installing-the-JumpCloud-PowerShell-Module)
