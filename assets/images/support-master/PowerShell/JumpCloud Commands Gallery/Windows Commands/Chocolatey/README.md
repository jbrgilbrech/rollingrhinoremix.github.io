## Using Chocolatey with JumpCloud

Chocolatey can be used in conjunction with JumpCloud commands to manage your software deployment. Chocolatey allows you to version your software, manage dependencies and installation order and many other features. 

The example commands in this repository rely on Chocolatey's [Open Source](https://chocolatey.org/products#foss) offering and the [community supported and maintained package repository](https://chocolatey.org/packages). That said, you certainly can configure your own Package Repository Server so that you have complete control over the binaries and what is installed on your systems. For more information about configuring your own Package Feed, please see [here](https://chocolatey.org/docs/how-to-host-feed).
